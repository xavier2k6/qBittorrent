# qBittorrent Icons
------------------------------------------

## Previous
Old icons were created by Bert Verhelst (<verhelstbert@gmail.com>).
Icons were based on the [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) icon set.
## Redesign
Redesigned icons are created by Nowshed H. Imran (<nowshed.imran@gmail.com>).
New icons are based on [la-capitaine-icon-theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme) and [ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons).
`la-capitaine` project is owned by Keefer Rourke and due permission was received before modifying them. Get an icon from there if needed.
`ionicons` project is under MIT license and thus it can be used freely.
## Color RGBA
Here is the following color RGBA used for icon uniformity.

Google provides a brilliant [Material](https://material.io/resources/color) website that helps to convert colors that work in both light and dark. It can be used to find colors that work best for different background colors.
## Icon Optimization
In order to optimize the icons [svgcleaner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/SVGCleaner) has been used.
Submit the icon without optimization first and after that, submit the optimized one.
It is recommended to use "Svgcleaner" as optimization tool, as it almost never breaks any icon.
